<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>


<p>When John Tutchin died on September 23, 1707, he had already
created the image of himself which Alexander Pope has transmitted to
posterity. There, in Book II of <i>The Dunciad</i> (1728), the Whig journalist
appears as one of two figures in a "shaggy Tap'stry":</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Earless on high, stood un-abash'd Defoe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Tutchin flagrant from the scourge, below.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Pope, in his variorum notes on the passage, identified Tutchin as the
"author of some vile verses, and of a weekly paper call'd the <i>Observator</i>,"
and revived the fiction of his sentence "to be whipp'd thro' several
towns in the west of <i>England</i>, upon which he petition'd King <i>James</i>
II. to be hanged." The "invective" against James II's memory, which
Pope mentions, has now been identified in the Twickenham Edition as
<i>The British Muse: or Tyranny Expos'd</i> (1701).<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>  By 1728, this was all
the reputation that remained for Mr. John Tutchin, Gentleman&mdash;irascible
journalist, pamphleteer, and writer of verses.</p>

<p>The truth of the matter is that Pope was no more accurate about
Tutchin's being whipped than about Defoe's losing his ears. From the
sparse reliable information concerning Tutchin's early years, one consistent
pattern emerges: he tended to depict himself as a hero and a
martyr. Born in 1661 "a Freeman" of London, he was brought up in a
family of scholarly nonconformist ministers probably on the Isle of
Wight<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>.  Even though an enemy claimed that he had been expelled from
a school at Stepney for stealing (<i>DNB</i>), he received some education
and travelled on the continent. In defending his skill with languages
against Defoe, he once told how at his school, boys translated and
capped verses, and how he travelled "from <i>Leivarden</i> in <i>Friezland</i>,
thro' <i>Holland</i> and the <i>Spanish Flanders</i>."<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Throughout his life, he
proudly designated himself a gentleman: during his trial for libel in
late June of 1704, he even escaped punishment by setting forth that he
was a gentleman, and not a laborer as the indictment read.</p>

<p>In later life, he romanticized himself when young as the hero who
fought in the Duke of Monmouth's rebellion, received the brutal "whipping
sentence" from Lord Chief-Justice Jeffreys during "the bloody
assezes" of 1685, petitioned James II for "the Favour of being hang'd"
<span class='pagenum'>- ii -</span>to avoid the sentence, and finally freed himself by paying so burdensome
a bribe that he was reduced to poverty. All these claims were
first made in "The Case, Trial, and Sentence of Mr. John Tutchin,
and Several Others, in Dorchester, in the County of Dorset," which
Tutchin added to the fifth edition of <i>The Western Martyrology; or,
the Bloody Assizes</i>, published in 1705. As J. G. Muddiman demonstrated
in 1929, most of these claims are outright fabrications. Tutchin
was never indicted for high treason, he could never have been
challenged by Jeffreys to cap verses, and he invented the petition
to be hanged.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> In <i>The Observator</i> (July 25-29, 1702), he honestly admitted
that he was never tried in Devonshire, but claimed he did buy
his liberty of James II; and in a later issue (Aug. 4-7, 1703) he challenged
an enemy: "if he Pleases to give the World an Account, <i>When</i>,
<i>Where</i>, and for <i>What</i> I was Whip'd thro' a Market-Town, he will inform
Mankind of more than I or any Body else knows...." John Dunton believed
in the whipping sentence; and Defoe, the story of the petition
to be hanged. Throughout Tutchin's stormy career, his enemies made
political capital of the flogging that never took place. He was probably
twenty-four years old when, using the alias "Thomas Pitts," he
was tried at Dorchester for "Spreading false news and fined five marks
and sentenced to be whipped"&mdash;but he came down with smallpox and
so was not whipped.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>  Lord Macaulay, who is incorrect on the facts
taken from <i>The Western Martyrology</i>, certainly exaggerated in stating
that Tutchin's temper was "exasperated to madness by what he had
undergone."<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>  That the Monmouth adventure and its aftermath mark a
turning point in the young man's life, however, cannot doubted.</p>

<p>Tutchin may have fought with William III's army in Ireland as an
officer.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>  After the Glorious Revolution and the establishment of
William and Mary on the throne, Tutchin devoted himself to a succession
of liberal causes. On the one hand, he persisted in identifying
himself with the former commonwealth, the Monmouth cause, the Revolution,
the reform movement especially in the theater, and Whig
liberty. He became noted for tactless expos&eacute;s of high-level misconduct
in his pamphlets and in <i>The Observator</i> (Apr. 1, 1702-Sept. 23,
1707). His detractors frequently paired him with Defoe as a monster
or a villain. Again and again, he made himself obnoxious to important
personages such as the Earl of Albemarle or the Duke of Marlborough.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
On the other hand, his hatred for tyranny propelled him frequently
into such extremes as his disgraceful complicity in William Fuller's
impostures. In the years 1700-1704, he was generally reputed to be
<span class='pagenum'>- iii -</span>"Secretary to the abominal Society of King-Killers"&mdash;the secret Calves-Head
Club made up of dissenters who met on January 30th, the
anniversary of the death of Charles I, to sing prophane anthems.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>Dunton generously summed up the widely varied causes of "the
loyal and ingenious <i>Tutchin</i> (alias <i>Master Observator</i>); the bold Asserter
of English Liberties; the scourge of the High-flyers; the Seaman's
Advocate; the Detector of the Victualling-office; the scorn and
terror of Fools and Knaves; the Nation's <i>Argus</i>, and the Queen's
faithful Subject."<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>  Even his death in Queen's Bench Prison, on
September 23, 1707, was romanticized into another instance of martyrdom.
"... <i>he liv'd and dy'd</i>," announced the Country-man of <i>The
Observator</i>, "<i>for the Service of his Country</i>."  Tutchin's followers
dramatized his death as the result of a politically-inspired thrashing
which "six ruffians" administered to him, in revenge for slanderous
remarks made in <i>The Observator</i> against Vice-Admiral Sir Thomas
Dilkes.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>  The "<i>Pulchrum Est Pro Patria Mori</i>" portrait, reprinted here
as the frontispiece, was circulated to attest to Tutchin's political
martyrdom. However, as the autopsy-report demonstrates and as Muddiman
rightly concludes, "Tutchin really died from a specific disease
and not from the thrashing undergone seven months before his death."<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>The young man of twenty four who went off to join Monmouth's
forces had already published, in 1685, <i>Poems on Several Occasions.
With a Pastoral. To Which is Added, A Discourse of Life</i>. In the preface,
writing like a fashionable man-about-town, Tutchin describes the
lyrics, translations, and satires of this volume as "trifles" which he
had let circulate and had now secured "by promising to Print them."
The book shows the variety in poetic kinds that one would expect in
a young writer who had been drinking deeply of Lord Rochester, Waller,
Cowley, the Earl of Roscommon, Oldham, and Dryden. Juvenalian
satires reminiscent of Oldham are neatly balanced by memorial verses
to Oldham and Rochester, late metaphysical lyrics ("And why in red
dost thou appear"), classical dialogues ("Cleopatra to Anthony"),
translations of Horace, and the well-turned "autobiographical" couplets
of "A Letter to A Friend." In its variety and themes, <i>Poems
on Several Occasions</i> resembles Oldham's <i>Works</i>, which was published
twice in 1684. Tutchin's "The Tory Catch," like Oldham's "A Dithyrambick.
A Drunkard's Speech in a Mask," has a speaker who ironically
brags of the social misconduct which the author satirizes. "A
Letter to a Friend" is a skillfully exaggerated account of the attractions
and dangers in rhyming. Although perhaps autobiographical in
<span class='pagenum'>- iv -</span>part, the poem also imitates the long-standing tradition derived from
Horace's first Epistle of Book I, and revived most recently in Oldham's
"A Letter from the Country to a Friend in Town."<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>  Both "The
Tory Catch" and "A Letter to a Friend" are reprinted here from <i>Poems
on Several Occasions</i>.</p>

<p>Tutchin's first book shows two impulses: the awkwardly lyrical
and the directly satiric. He feels compelled, in the Preface, to defend
his choice of less serious subjects. His light poems do not,
"in the least, detract from <i>Virtue</i>; since I have Read the <i>Poems</i> of
<i>Beza</i>, <i>Heinsius</i>, our own <i>Donne</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i>" He promises to turn to "some
Graver Subject." There are other equally significant comments in a
Preface that reveals a great deal about changing literary taste. In
"To the Memory of Mr. John Oldham," Tutchin curiously avoids the
main subject of Dryden's finer elegy, namely, Oldham's achievement
in rough satire. His praise is that "<i>Crashaw</i> and <i>Cowley</i> both did live
in thee." However, in his "Satyr Against Vice" and "Satyr Against
Whoring," Tutchin has already learned the art of declaiming, from
the poet who has been called "the English Juvenal," John Oldham.</p>

<p>In the years between 1685 and 1707, Tutchin's separate poems
were mainly occasional and satirical. Panegyric for William III
dominates such an early piece as <i>An Heroic Poem upon the Late
Expedition of His Majesty</i> (1689), and hatred for the Stuarts possesses
a later poem like <i>The British Muse: or Tyranny Expos'd</i> (1701). In
<i>Civitas Militaris</i> (1690) Tutchin engages in city politics. The elegy
on the death of Queen Mary irritated Defoe enough to have "<i>T&mdash;&mdash;n</i>"
placed among the "Pindarick Legions" in <i>The Pacificator</i> (1700).
Two poems, however,&mdash;<i>The Earth-quake of Jamaica</i> (1692) and <i>Whitehall
in Flames</i> (1698)&mdash;differ from the others in that they are Cowleyan
"Pindaricks" moralizing on disasters. <i>The Earth-quake of
Jamaica</i> is reprinted here to illustrate Tutchin's descriptive talent.
He starts with an actual event, the Jamaican disaster of June 7, 1692;
and then, as the epigraph on the title page suggests, he presents a
variation on Horace's rejection of "senseless Epicureanism," in
Ode 34 of Book I. <i>The Earth-quake of Jamaica</i> may have been worked
over longer than was customary. It was published shortly before
December 10, the manuscript date on Narcissus Luttrell's copy now
in the Houghton Library. Some six months earlier, in the late morning
of June 7, the earthquake had erupted in Port Royal, the "boom" port
on the south side of the island. In three schocks lasting less than
three minutes, the famed capital of the buccaneers had fallen. News
<span class='pagenum'>- v -</span>of the disaster did not reach London until August 9. The earthquake
then became one of the most widely discussed events. The <i>London
Gazette</i> ran stories on it, scientists like Sir Hans Sloane published
eye-witness accounts in the <i>Philosophical Transactions</i> of the Royal
Society, the moralists declared God's wrath had come upon the wickedest
place in Christendom, and "the actors of the drolls" in Southwark
Fair even mockingly re-enacted the event until the Lord Mayor
put a stop to the performances.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>If contemporary accounts of the Port Royal earthquake are compared
with <i>The Earth-quake of Jamaica</i>, the reader becomes impressed
by Tutchin's way of adapting the well-known details to a moral comment
on life. His scenes are indeed graphic, but they do not have the
immediacy of such eye-witness accounts as the following, preserved
by Luttrell:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I cannot sufficiently represent the terrible circumstances
that attended it; the earth swelled with a
dismal humming noise, the houses fell, the earth
opened in many places, the graves gave up some of
their dead, the tomb stones ratled together; at last
the earth sunk below the water, and the sea overwhelmed
great numbers of people, whose shreiks
and groanes made a lamentable eccho: the earth
opened both behind and before me within 2 foot of
my feet, and that place on which I stood trembled
exceedingly; the water immediately boyled up upon
the opening of the earth, but it pleased God to preserve
me....<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p></div>

<p>Tutchin's aim is to compare vulnerable nature with vulnerable man:
"Can humane Race / Stand on their / Legs when Nature Reels?" He
sees in the disaster a challenge for English sinners to repent: the
"Hurricane of Fate" wails on "murder'd <i>Cornish</i>." He had not yet
forgotten the Monmouth adventure. For he alludes here to the act of
Parliament passed in 1689 reversing the attainder of Henry Cornish,
the alderman who had been brutally executed in 1685 for high treason
through participating in the Rye House Plot and attaching himself to
the Duke of Monmouth. For Tutchin, politics were always relevant.</p>

<p>Tutchin's true forte is not the descriptive poem, but satire. Poems
published in the years 1696 to 1705&mdash;from <i>A Pindarick Ode</i> to
<span class='pagenum'>- vi -</span>
<i>The Tackers</i>&mdash;exploit the satirical impulse that had been latent in <i>Poems
on Several Occasions</i>. Increasingly he turns to general denunciation
and thinly disguised lampoon. Of the two main Augustan traditions
in satire&mdash;the "fine raillery" that Dryden perfected and the rough satire
that reached back to Donne, Cleveland, and Oldham&mdash;Tutchin belongs
to the latter. Defoe found him to be "so woundy touchy, and so willing
to quarrel," and noted that "Want of Temper was his capital
Error."<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> The specific circumstance that produced <i>A Pindarick Ode,
in the Praise of Folly and Knavery</i> (1696), reprinted here, is generally
said to be his dismissal from the victualling office because he
failed to establish his case that the commissioners mismanaged public
funds. Such corruption in the administration would soon transform
a deep admiration for William III into the disenchantment of <i>The Foreigners</i>
(1700). That Tutchin was uneasy in his effort to write satire
in the mode of Dryden is suggested by his abandonment of irony after
the first part of <i>A Pindarick Ode</i>. In his introductory verses, Benjamin
Bridgwater accurately observes that Erasmus' <i>Ironia</i> no longer
suffices:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">This hard'ned Age do's rougher Means require,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We must be <i>Cupp'd</i> and <i>Cauteriz'd</i> with <i>Fire</i>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Echoing Dryden's <i>Mac Flecknoe</i>, Tutchin invites Dullness and "Immortal
<i>Nonsence</i>" to inspire his ironic praise of the folly and knavery
that now ride roughshod over such traditional values as learning,
love, wit, and patriotism. A few of the lines have the moving quality
of Augustan satire at its best:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Did e'er the old or new Philosophy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Make a Man splendid live, or wealthy die?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The irony of <i>A Pindarick Ode</i> does not adequately mask the denunciation.
In Stanza X, it is even replaced by the antiquated Hero's
diatribe against "our modern Knavish Arts"&mdash;never to return to the
rest of the poem. Doubtless, the indictment of the "nefarious Brood
at Home" that grows rich in wartime was the heart of the satire.
Defoe hinted at this motive in the satirical vignette of Tutchin as
Shamwhig, which appeared in the first edition of <i>The True-Born
Englishman</i> (1700):</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'>- vii -</span></p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">As Proud as Poor, his Masters he'll defy;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And writes a <i>Piteous *Satyr</i> upon Honesty.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some think the Poem had been pretty good,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>If he the Subject had but understood</i>.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He got Five hundred Pence by this, and more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>As sure as he had ne're a Groat before</i>.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Tutchin's satire would be henceforth the rough variety. In <i>The
Foreigners</i> he would also resort to fierce lampoons of William III's
court favorites.</p>

<p>In the rash of satires that followed <i>The Foreigners</i> and <i>The True-Born
Englishman</i>, the anonymous author of <i>The Fable of the Cuckoo</i>
(1701) pointed to the common tradition shared by both poems. For he
attacked Defoe's "hatchet muse" as having been inspired by such
"Modern Sharpers of the Town" as Tutchin and "Old[ha]m the Bell-weather
of Tory Faction," who first horned Defoe's satire, "And ever
since perverted all good Nature." Advertised in <i>The Flying Post</i> for
July 31-Aug. 1, 1700, <i>The Foreigners</i> was published shortly thereafter
by the ardent Whig Anne Baldwin. The "vile abhor'd Pamphlet, in
very ill Verse, written by one <i>Mr. Tutchin</i>, and call'd <i>The Foreigners</i>"&mdash;Defoe
recalled years later in <i>An Appeal to Honour and Justice</i>
(1715)&mdash;filled him "with a kind of Rage." Tutchin's irascible temper
had again taken hold. Scurrilously, he assailed foreigners in high
office, especially William III's Dutch favorites, for their monopolizing
preferments and usurping command, under such transparent aliases as
"Bentir" for William Bentinck, first Earl of Portland, and "Keppech"
for Arnold Joost van Keppel, first Earl of Albemarle. The manner was
Dryden's in <i>Absalom and Achitophel</i>; the venom was Tutchin's own.
Official reaction to <i>The Foreigners</i> came quickly. The untrustworthy
William Fuller spread the gossip that Tutchin fled from his Majesty's
messengers, and found refuge "in a blind Ale-house, at the Windmill,
by Mr. Bowyers, at Camberwel." On August 10th, he was taken "into
custody of a messenger"; and at the grand inquest for the city of
London, held on August 28th, there was presented "a Poem called
<i>The Foreigners</i>."<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> A mystery envelops the rest of the legal proceedings.
There may even be some truth in the allegation that the parry
would long since have "ruffled" Tutchin, except that he pleased them
with his "railing at King <i>William's</i> Friends sometimes."<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> <i>The
Foreigners</i> also aroused such ephemeral rejoinders as <i>The Reverse:
or, the Tables Turn'd</i> and <i>The Nations: An Answer to the Foreigners</i>.
<span class='pagenum'>- viii -</span>both published in 1700. Finally, in January of 1701, there was published
a satire of more lasting worth, Defoe's <i>The True-Born Englishman</i>.
Side by side, in <i>Poems on Affairs of State</i> (1703), were reprinted
<i>The Foreigners</i> and <i>The True-Born Englishman</i> among verses
"<i>Written by the Greatest Wits of this Age</i>."<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Altogether, the two
satirists had three poems apiece in the volume. One of Tutchin's
poems, "The Tribe of Levi" (1691), was anonymously reprinted; the
other two, <i>The Foreigners</i> and <i>The British Muse</i>, were identified as
"by Mr. <i>T&mdash;&mdash;n</i>." These were the achievements of Tutchin's "hatchet
muse."</p>

<p>The poems are reprinted from copies in libraries of the U.S. and
Great Britain. I am obligated to The Houghton Library for <i>Poems on
Several Occasions</i> and <i>The Earth-quake of Jamaica</i>, to Yale University
Library for <i>The Foreigners</i>, and to the British Museum for <i>A
Pindarick Ode, in the Praise of Folly and Knavery</i>. For permission
to reproduce the "<i>Pulchrum Est Pro Patria Mori</i>" portrait of John
Tutchin as the frontispiece, I wish to express my thanks to the
Trustees of the British Museum.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> Tutchin's birth-year is variously given. The Van der Gucht
engraving and the authentic <i>Elegy</i> of Tutchin's death state that
he died "Aged 44"; but the mock <i>Elegy</i>, falsely claiming to be
"Written by the Author of the Review," gives his age to be 47.
In <i>The Observator</i> (Oct. 20-23, 1703), Tutchin implied that he
was "Born some years after the Restoration of King <i>Charles</i> the
2d." His certificate of marriage to Elizabeth Hicks on Sept. 30,
1686 places his age then at twenty-five, and supports the birth-year
1661, as given in the <i>DNB</i>. See also <i>The Observator</i>, May
17-20, 1704; July 8-12, 1704; and July 24-28, 1703. One of
Tutchin's enemies charged that he was born in the north of England
(<i>An Account of the Birth, Education, Life and Conversation of ...
the Observator</i>, 1705); and another, that his father was "a Scot,
canting Presbyterian Sot" (<i>The Picture of the Observator</i>, 1704).</p></div>

his activities in Holland. See J. G. Muddiman, ed., <i>The Bloody
Assizes</i> (Toronto, [1929]), p. 137.</p></div>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1

compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than

that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any

electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
